# mech_proj_3
mechatronic project 3- just the arduino code, no documentation. sorry

project 1 was a two-wheel, 3x servo robot (Arduino microcontroller based) that 
was controlled via Bluetooth

project 2 was a classic line-follower robot. competition for fastest traversal of course. came in 3rd place out of 50.

project 3 was a maze solver in the traditional sense. There was no ML involved. ultrasonic sensors were used to 
detect walls and make it around the course.
